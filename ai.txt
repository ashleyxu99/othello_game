1. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something
  more clever than just pick a random legal move?
  A:
  Yes, I did attempt to make my computer player do something more
  clever than just pick a random legal move.

2. If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as
  you would like?
  A:
  Yes, I was able to accomplish it, and my computer player is as
  smart as I would like.

3. How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next
  move” algorithm?
  A:
  Loop through every possible square:
      If the square is empty:
          Search for all possible flips for this empty square.
          If there are flips for this empty square:
              Count all the flips in all the directions and put the counts in
              a dictionary.

  If the flips in the dictionary are not empty:
      Sort the flip counts for all the legal moves in ascending order.
      Get the best move which has the most flip count.

4. How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever
  tested it out for you?
  A:
  The probablity that the computer program would beat me or my friend was 75%.

5. How would you improve it in the future?
  A:
  In the future, I would calculate the distance of legal move to the boundaries,
  because the smaller the distance, the greater chance that it is able to compass and flips more
  opposing tiles.
